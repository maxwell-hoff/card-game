  <h1 style="margin-top:0;">Cascade</h1>
  <p style="max-width:760px;">Cascade is a cooperative strategy card puzzle designed to be played <strong>in person</strong> with a small group. Think of it as a modern successor to classic gathering games like Bridge: you get the social connection and table talk, plus the modern perks of computers: automatic progress tracking, unlimited challenge progression, and millions of auto-balanced puzzles.</p>

  <h2>Why play</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bring people together</strong>: a simple shared board that sparks collaboration and strategy discussions.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve Critical Thinking</strong>: puzzles require multi-step planning and difficulty increases as you improve.</li>
    <li><strong>Modern appeal</strong>: computers curate the <em>right</em> challenge via puzzle generation and optimization—balanced difficulty and guaranteed solvability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p style="max-width:760px;">Each puzzle lays out a 5-column grid with row and column reserves. Your goal is to transform the starting layout into the solved layout within the target number of turns. On your turn you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Move a row</strong> one step left or right.</li>
    <li><strong>Move a column</strong> one step up or down.</li>
    <li><strong>Swap two cards</strong> within a row.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Work together to sequence these moves efficiently. Communication is encouraged!</p>

  <h2>Play styles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Together, in person</strong> (recommended): sit around a table, sign in, and play as a group. Invite teammates using their Player ID from the header.</li>
    <li><strong>Solo practice</strong>: you can play alone to learn mechanics and improve. The game is meant for groups but supports solo play to get the hang of it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Site navigation</h2>
